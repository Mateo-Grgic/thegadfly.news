                <p>The Gadfly is an independent satirical newspaper. Student-first &amp; student-run, while we technically operate at LHSS as a 'club', we still operate by ourselves (with slight oversight &amp; ocasional edits). We attempt to deliver amusing content, interesting ideas, and high-quality writing.</p>

                    <h3>The Beginning  -  [May 2025]</h3>
                    <p>The story of The Gadfly begins with '<a href="pages/backcast.html" class="subtle-link">The Backcast</a>', a satirical newspaper with largely the same spirit as The Gadfly, but unrefined (and unsanctioned). Our first issue was released in May of 2025.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Fall  -  [June 2025]</h3>
                    <p>The Backcast continued the next month. In June 2025, issue #2 of The Backcast was published. Due to a combination of effects (Being unsanctioned, printing slightly controversial things, putting up posters whilst being unsanctioned, etc) The Backcast was formally shut down.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Rebirth  -  [Summer Break 2025]</h3>
                    <p>After a small party to celebrate the life &amp; times of The Backcast, we decided to continue the paper officially. We originally planned on calling our paper 'The Outcast', but out of concern that the name might sound too similar to Backcast or Forecast, we decided to piviot entirely. And, like that, The Gadfly was born. We spent the summer crafting our founding docs, and writing our first issue.</p>

                    <h3>The Gadfly Today  -  [September 2025]</h3>
                    <p>With our heads held high, our newspaper &amp; founding docs in hand, we met with our principal as soon as possibly possible. He graciously allowed us to continue, even with our stipulations of not being a club in the traditional manner (not allowing people in freely, no club fair, etc); we thank him greatly for this. We found a teacher sponsor who meshed well with The Gadfly, and after minor revisions &amp; edits, we published our first issue under The Gadfly name.</p>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Preamble</h2>
                    <p>The Gadfly is an independent, democratic, student-driven satirical newspaper that needs no introduction. In order to protect the foundations of this newspaper, all members are bound by the following rules, subject to change at regular intervals (See section V for more details).</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>I. Rights as a Member</h2>
                    <p>As a member of The Gadfly, you are entitled to certain rights. You additionally are expected to honour all other members' rights. You have the right to anonymity; The Steering Committee does not (See section III. for expansion on the steering committee). You have the right to leave The Gadfly at any point with no consequences. You have the right to speak your mind, while understanding that certain things may be moderated by The Steering Committee or by consensus to protect the newspaper and its members.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>II. Staying Indie</h2>
                    <p>Staying independent is an important part of The Gadfly, but it needs to be done in a way that protects the members of The Gadfly from punishment. The Gadfly will have a teacher adviser; this differs from a sponsor. A teacher adviser will review the final copy of an issue before we release it. They will point out risks and issues. Their advice is non-binding, though it will be heavily considered.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>III. Steering Committee</h2>
                    <p>Although The Gadfly is consensus-driven, there will be a two-layered participation system. The upper layer (known as the 'Steering Committee') will draft the rules for everyone to vote on at the time of review, and make quick time-sensitive decisions. The other tier will still have autonomy over most matters. Unanimity can override any decisions that the Steering Committee makes, and the Steering Committee will discuss every decision they make with everyone. When the Steering Committee dies, leaves, or otherwise moves on, they are expected to provide a written 'last will' that describes their plans for The Gadfly until a new Steering Committee is created.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>IV. Distribution</h2>
                    <p>In the spirit of our anti-establishment ideologies, our distribution style is highly decentralised. Every member who is able to print is encouraged to print several copies of The Gadfly. We will also distribute copies of The Gadfly digitally through email, QR codes, etc.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>V. Voting</h2>
                    <p>Every two publications, or whenever a problem arises, the rules (The OAoAfTG) will be re-evaluated by The Steering Committee and voted on by the group as a whole. New rules, changes, and members will not go forwards without at least 70% (or the next closest number, relative to group size) in favour, though we will strive for unanimity. The current member cap is six people.</p>
